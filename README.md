# GTASA-x-Winamp-Radio-Tool
A tool that mutes/unmutes winamp depending on whether the radio would play in GTASA. Also supports pausing/unpausing it and other players.

Should work with the most common versions of GTASA. Versions of winamp other than 5.666 not supported, but might work.

I'll add support for other versions/games/tools if there's demand.
