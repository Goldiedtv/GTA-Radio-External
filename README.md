# GTASA-x-Winamp-Radio-Tool
A tool that mutes/unmutes winamp depending on whether the radio would play in GTASA

Probably only works with the V3.0 version of GTASA and God I dont even know how to describe which version of Winamp it works on. (probably the last release before they went bankrupt)

I'll add support for other versions if there's demand, but I primarily made this for myself so yeah. Just go into the mess of a source code (this is the first C# tool I made) and edit the corresponding memory values yourself :D
