# GTA Radio External
A tool that mutes/unmutes external music players depending on whether the radio would play in GTA.

Features:  
-Supports GTA3, VC & SA  
-Supports Winamp v5.666 and Foobar2000 v1.3.14  
-Can Mute or Pause music when radio stops  

To add:  
-Log settings to file so the tool doesn't need configuring every time it's booted  
-Proper muting rather than jury rigging it with volume control.  
-Custom hotkey support  
-Cool stuff  
 
Notes:  
All this program does is read memory values from the game and the music player, then sends appropriate media controls (volume up/down, pause/play). It does not directly write to the music player or the game.  
Foobar will need its volume up/down controls bound manually to these buttons, as it does not support them natively (play/pause IS supported natively)
